# ICECCS 2018
This repository provides data and code used for the evaluation of a modelling and verification framework for large-scale wireless sensor network (WSN) infrastructures published in a paper titled "Modelling and Verification of Large-Scale Sensor Network Infrastructures" at the 23rd International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2018).

## Data

### Input dataset
The folder provides a dataset ([input_dataset/ENO_Box_3B06.csv](https://github.com/mkabac/iceccs-2018/blob/master/data/input_dataset/ENO_Box_3B06.csv)) collected from a microclimate WSN deployment in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (QEOP) over the period of two months [1] as depicted in the figure below.

Nodes in the deployed WSN collected data from multiple sensors (e.g. temperature, humidity, light Level,	atmospheric pressure) and provided also data on the their internal state (e.g. consumed energy, generated energy, battery state, etc.)) as well as a timestamp indicating the occurrence of sensing.
